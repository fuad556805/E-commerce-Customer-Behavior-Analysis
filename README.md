## Project Overview

This project focuses on **E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis** using **Python**, applying both **statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover meaningful insights from customer data.

The analysis progresses from **basic descriptive statistics** to **intermediate correlations** and finally to **critical business insights**, following a structured and analytical workflow. The project is designed to reflect **real-world data analytics practices** and business-oriented thinking.

---

## Dataset Used

* **E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset** (`ecommerce_customer_behavior_dataset.csv`)

### Key Features

* Customer Demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
* Purchase Information (Purchase Amount, Items Purchased)
* Review Scores & Customer Satisfaction
* Subscription Status & Discount Availed
* Payment Method & Device Type
* Delivery Time & Return Customer Flag

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical computation
* **SciPy** – Statistical analysis
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Seaborn** – Statistical plotting
* **Plotly** – Interactive visualization

---

## Project Workflow

### Data Loading & Exploration

* Imported dataset using Pandas
* Examined dataset structure using `.info()` and `.head()`
* Identified missing values and duplicate records

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed duplicate rows
* Standardized column names
* Converted data types where necessary

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Univariate analysis using histograms and boxplots
* Bivariate analysis using scatter plots and bar charts
* Group-based aggregation and comparisons

## Key Analysis & Insights

### Level 1: Basic Insights

1. Mean, Median, and Mode of customer age
2. Variance, standard deviation, and Z-score of purchase amount
3. Top 3 product categories by purchase frequency
4. Return vs new customer distribution
5. Average customer review score
6. Delivery time comparison by subscription status
7. Subscription status distribution
8. Device usage percentage (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet)
9. Impact of discounts on purchase amount
10. Most common payment method

### Level 2: Intermediate Insights

1. Average review score by payment method
2. Correlation between time spent on website and purchase amount
3. Percentage of satisfied (rating 4–5) return customers
4. Relationship between items purchased and customer satisfaction
5. Location with the 2nd highest average purchase amount

### Level 3: Critical Thinking Insights

1. Factors influencing return customers (gender, discount impact)
2. Payment method influence on satisfaction and return rate
3. Location-based comparison of purchase amount and delivery time
4. 3D analysis of customer satisfaction vs average items purchased
